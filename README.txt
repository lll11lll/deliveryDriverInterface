My idea for this project was to create an interface that allowed me to input data related
to my delivery driving job and tips mades. Prior to this I was tracking my tips by manual
putting it into excel, however with this project I no longer have to do this, I can just 
launch my program and do it fromr there. Another big stepping stone in this project was 
recoding the whole project into an object oriented way, which allowed my code to look
more readible, and further develop my oop skills.

One issues I faced when working on the project was when I found out I made 7.98 an hour and
not 6.98. This issue caused me to update my whole excel sheet, and fix the wage amount,
hourly rate, and daily total columns.
